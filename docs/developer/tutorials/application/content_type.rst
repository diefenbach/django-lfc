Create a content type
=====================

In order to create a own content type you just need to add few lines of code 
within models.py

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # python imports
    import datetime

    # django imports
    from django import forms
    from django.db import models

    # lfc imports
    from lfc.models import BaseContent
    from lfc.utils.registration import register_content_type

    class Event(BaseContent):
        """A simple event type for LFC.
        """
        start = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, default=datetime.datetime.now)
        end = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, default=datetime.datetime.now)

        def form(self, **kwargs):
            """Returns the add/edit form of the Event
            """
            return EventForm(**kwargs)

    class EventForm(forms.ModelForm):
        """Form to add / edit an Event.
        """
        class Meta:
            model = Event
            fields = ("title", "slug", "description", "start", "end")
        
        # register the content type
        register_content_type(obj = Event, name = "Event",  
            templates=["Event 1", "Event 2"], default_template="Event 1")
            
            
1-6:
    Default imports from python and django.

9:
    BaseContent is the base class from which all LFC content types should 
    inherit.

10:
    Import the utility method to register a content type.

12:
    The new content type. Inherits from BaseContent.

15/16:
    
    Adds default Django fields to the content type, in this case two date/time 
    fields.

18-21
    The form method is the only method which has to be implemented by a LFC
    content type. It has to return the form to add/edit the related content
    type.
    
23-28
    Default Django model form to add/edit the Event type.
    
31/32:
    Registers the content type to LFC's model registration, which means in this
    case:  
    
    * We register the model Event under the name "Event". 
    * An Event has two possible templates from which the user can choose: 
      "Event 1" and "Event 2" (which has to be written yet).
    * The default template is "Event 1".
